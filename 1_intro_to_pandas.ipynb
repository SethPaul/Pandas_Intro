    "### Beginner:\n",
    "  * read in data (csv)\n",
    "  * create DF from dict\n",
    "  * slice/subset\n",
    "  * get aggregate eg. means, mins, etc\n",
    "  * create new columsn with simple operations ie. df['C'] = df['A'] + df['B']\n",
    "  * write data (csv)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intermediate:\n",
    "  * groupby \n",
    "  * joins\n",
    "  * fill/interpolate/drop\n",
    "  * column wide custom modifications eg. string parsing, df.apply()\n",
    "  * custom filtering/selection methods eg. df[df['A']>0], select specific row(s)/column(s) values using .ix, .iloc, .loc\n",
    "  * some indexing manipulation\n",
